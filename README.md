# Final Project Template

## Getting started

When setting up the project for the first time, you'll need to:

* Download the template as a ZIP archive, unarchive it, and save it somewhere on your computer. You'll probably want to rename the project directory from "final-project-template-master" to something that's appropriate for your project.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `git init` to make it a git repository.
* Let's make our first commit! `git add -A` and then `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
* On GitHub, let's create a new remote repository by going to "New repository" in the "+" menu in the upper right hand corner of GitHub.
* Give your repository an appropriate name, probably similar to the directory name you used above, and a description.
* The defaults are fine for the other fields.
* We now run the commands in the "...or push an existing repository from the command line" example shown on the resulting page.

## Publishing to Github Pages

We need to have a `gh-pages` branch on GitHub. GitHub will automatically make whatever commits are on that branch accessible at [yourusername].github.io/[yourreponame].

In order to create that branch for the first time:

* Create and checkout a new branch by running `git checkout -b gh-pages`.
* Push that branch to GitHub by running `git push -u origin gh-pages`.
* Remember to checkout your `master` branch again before making additional changes, with `git checkout master`.

Every subsequent time you want to publish new changes (after committing them!), these steps become:

* `git checkout gh-pages`
* `git push`
* `git checkout master`

## Running a local server

If you haven't yet installed [reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reload) globally, run `npm install -g reload'.

After that, any time you want to work on your project, run `reload -b` from the project directory, perhaps in a second tab so you can continue to use git. (If it doesn't work, it could be a port conflict, so you might try specifying a different port like this: `reload -b -p 4567`.)
